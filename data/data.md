# Project

## Data generation

### Tools
- Using [blender 2.83](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-83/) due to compatibility with the following add-on
  - Using an add-on by `alexsui05`: [ https://github.com/alextsui05/blender-off-addon ] to import OFF files into blender. Follow the instruction in their README on how to install the add-on.
- Python 3.7.4+ (we are using Python 3.11 and it works). If you do not already have Python installed, downloading Blender also comes with python in its python folder.

### Image generating parameters

- TODO: Decide as we do
